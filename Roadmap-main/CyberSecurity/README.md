# CAT_Reloaded-Cyber_Security-Road_Map

## **About Cyber Security**
### What is Cyber Security? 
Cyber Security is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, damage, or theft.
### Why Cyber Security  
+ According to the IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report, the global average cost of a data breach surged to USD 4.45 million in 2023, marking a 15% increase in three years. 
	Consequently, 51% of organizations plan to boost security investments, focusing on incident response planning, employee training, and advanced threat detection tools. This underscores the escalating financial impact of breaches, prompting a strategic shift towards fortified cybersecurity measures to mitigate risks and preserve organizational resilience.
+ The fact that the Middle East ranks second in data breach costs by region, averaging USD 8.07 million after the United States, signals a growing necessity for individuals aspiring to learn cybersecurity. This trend underscores the increasing demand for cybersecurity professionals in the region's future landscape.

## Essential skills Before Cyber Security 

Before delving into Cyber Security, it is essential to acquire foundational skills. These skills serve as a strong base, allowing for a comprehensive understanding and proficiency in the field.

1. **An awareness of computer science and programming concepts is essential.**
2. security essential skills 
	- Network basics
	- Linux OS awareness 
	- Cryptography fundamentals
	- Bash scripting
